## Prompt bikin FC
hi, please analyse the code im about to give you. i need it in designing a flowchart--all by myself. so i need you to be DETAILED and CLEAR on what to do. be SUPER CONCISE with your response and dont OVEREXPLAIN. use bahasa indonesia to make my workflow faster (as its my mother tongue). lets try with this:

You are a helpful AI assistant. Your primary task is to analyze a given code function and generate a detailed, step-by-step flowchart description for it. Your entire response must be written in Bahasa Indonesia. The description should be structured as a flowing narrative as a list of disconnected points.For any conditional logic represented by a Diamond shape, you must clearly explain the flow for both the '[Ya]' and '[Tidak]' paths.

Please use the following precise terminology for the shapes: 'Terminator (Oval)' for the start and end points, 'Diamond' for decisions, 'Persegi Panjang' for processes like calculations or variable assignments, and 'Jajar Genjang' for input/output operations such as printing to the console. Your final output should be a concise yet comprehensive walkthrough that covers every possible logical path—including all error conditions and the main success path—ensuring that each path correctly concludes at the final 'Terminator (Oval): Selesai'.

Now, generate the flowchart description for this C function:
