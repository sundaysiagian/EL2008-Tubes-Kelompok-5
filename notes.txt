Based on your codebase, the hospital scheduling system must satisfy 7 main constraints:

Core Constraints (from constraints.c)
Shift Capacity Constraint - Each shift cannot exceed the maximum number of doctors per shift (MAX_DOCTORS_PER_SHIFT)

No Duplicate Assignment - A doctor cannot be assigned to the same shift twice

No Consecutive Shifts in Same Day - A doctor cannot work consecutive shifts on the same day (e.g., morning + afternoon, or afternoon + night)

Maximum 3 Night Shifts per Week - Each doctor can only work a maximum of 3 night shifts per week

Maximum 5 Total Shifts per Week - Each doctor can only work a maximum of 5 shifts total per week

No Back-to-Back Shifts - A doctor cannot work a night shift followed immediately by a morning shift the next day

Shift Preference Compliance - Doctors should only be assigned to shifts they prefer (pagi/siang/malam preferences)

Additional Validation Rules
The system also performs these validations:

No Empty Shifts - Every shift must have at least one doctor assigned
Workload Distribution - The algorithm tries to balance workload among doctors
Implementation Notes
The apakahAlokasiValid() function checks constraints 1-3, 6, and 7
The hitungShiftDokterMinggu() and hitungShiftMalamDokterMinggu() functions help enforce constraints 4 and 5
The validasiConstraintLengkap() function performs comprehensive validation of all constraints
The system can optionally ignore preference constraints (constraint 7) if no valid schedule can be found with all preferences honored
These constraints ensure fair workload distribution, respect doctor preferences, and maintain operational requirements for the hospital.

format:
"nama,maks_shift_mingguan,pref_pagi,pref_siang,pref_malam"
- nama is anything with Dr. and a one word name
- maks_shift_mingguan is somewhere between 1-21
- pref_pagi/siang/malam is filled with either 0 (do not prefer) or 1 (prefer) the respective shift

for example, if pref_pagi is 0, means the doctor would not prefer working on morning shifts

i need you to make me 7 separate .csv snippets, obeying the format, to test each constraint that i have made for my program
